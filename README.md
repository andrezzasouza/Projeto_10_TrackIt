<h2 id="about">About</h2>

TrackIt is a web application that you can use to track your habits.

It allows you to:

- Create an account
- Log into a created account
- Log income and expenses
- Review list of incomes and expenses
- Check out how much money (or debt) you currently have
- Log out to keep your data safe

This app can help you establish a new habit and keep it. Choose how your dream routine would be like and let TrackIt guide you towards it!

<h3>Why?</h3>

TrackIt is my dream app. As a person who has picked up habits only to stop after a while, TrackIt is amazing because it holds you accountable and it motivates you to log in your habits every day.

The great sensation you feel when you check that a habit is completed is wonderful and I believe many people can benefit from an app like that.
